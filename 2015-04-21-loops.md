# Lesson 4 - Loops!

## What is a loop and why do we need them?
A loop is a block of code that repeats. We use loops when we want to repeat
something until a condition is met. There are many different types of loops in
java.

Say we want to print out the message, "Hey pay attention" a *whole buncha times*:

```
Hey pay attention
Hey pay attention
Hey pay attention
Hey pay attention
Hey pay attention
Hey pay attention
Hey pay attention
Hey pay attention
Hey pay attention
Hey pay attention
```

One way to do that would be to use `System.out.println()` 10 times:

```java
System.out.println("Hey pay attention");
System.out.println("Hey pay attention");
System.out.println("Hey pay attention");
System.out.println("Hey pay attention");
System.out.println("Hey pay attention");
System.out.println("Hey pay attention");
System.out.println("Hey pay attention");
System.out.println("Hey pay attention");
System.out.println("Hey pay attention");
System.out.println("Hey pay attention");
```

This is kind of ridiculous and a waste of time.
We could produce the same output with less effort using a **for loop**:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    System.out.println("Hey pay attention");
}
```

The other benefit to using a loop besides being shorter, is that it makes your
code easier to change later (and cleaner).

## Types of Loops

### The for Loop

The for loop specializes in doing things a set number of times, because it gives
you a **counter variable** to keep track of the current iteration (first time,
second time, third time, etc...) a **test**, which is essentially an *if
statement* to check if the loop should keep running and an **increment** or
**decrement** where you can adjust the value in the *counter variable*.

Let's break down the *for loop* from our previous example:

```java
//   counter;   test;    increment / decrement
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    System.out.println("Hey pay attention");
}
```

### The While Loop

The interesting thing about loops, is that they are interchangeable in that any
loop that you use can be written to use a different loop. Let's see how the
**while loop** operates:

```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    System.out.println("Hey pay attention");
    i++;
}
```

The format of the while loop is:

```java
while (/* condition */) {
    // do something crazy!
}
```

Another example of a while loop (without a counter):

```java
boolean keepGoing = false;
while (keepGoing) {
    System.out.println("Hey pay attention");
}
```

In this case, the loop never runs because `keepGoing` is set to `false`  
What happens when we set `keepGoing` to `true`? It doesn't stop running at all!
(In this case, you can press Ctrl-C to stop the program from running)

As we've seen, the while loop checks the condition *before* the code inside the
loop runs. Which brings us to the next loop.

### The Do Loop

The **do loop** loop also called the **do while loop** is exactly the same as
the while loop, but a little different. The *do loop* runs its code once, *then*
checks the condition to see if it should keep going. This is opposite of how the
for and while loops work. In the for and while loops, we check the conditions
before running the loop.

```java
boolean keepGoing = false;
do {
    System.out.println("Hey pay attention");
} while (keepGoing);
```
