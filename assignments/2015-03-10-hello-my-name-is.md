# Assignment for lesson 1
*updated 2015-03-14 15:04:05 -0700*

## Before Coding
Before writing any code, please follow the instructions one step at a time.
I want you to write this code *incrementally*, meaning that you should *not*
read ahead. Write enough code to satisfy each step, one step at a time. Then,
compile your code and watch it run.

The idea of doing one step at a time may seem tiring and it may not contribute
much right now, but this routine will come into play later. Once everyone is
familiar with [git][] I will expect each step to have its own commit. If you
know how to do that already, you may. If you don't, that's okay tooâ€”I will only
check the final product for this first assignment.

## Extra credit / practice

For extra practice create a new code file for each step. These files can be
named `StepOne.java`, `StepTwo.java`, `StepThree.java` and so on.

__*Avoid using copy and paste for whole files and code snippets. It will help you
practice.*__

## Hi, my name is...
Write a program that will print out your name.

In class we talked about how to write text on the screen in java using
`System.out.print` and `System.out.println`. 

### Step 1 - Create the java file

Create a java file called `HiMyNameIs.java` which contains the class,
`HiMyNameIs`, and add the `main` method. If you get stuck check out our
HelloWorld example from your notes.

Compile your code and run it.
If you did this step right, you should see nothing on the screen.

### Step 2 - Print your name only 

Write some code to print out only your first name. When you are done the output
should look like this, using my name, for example:

```
Gregory
```

## Step 3 - Add "Hi, my name is"

Add "Hi, my name is" at the beginning so that your output looks like this,
using my name for example:

```
Hi, my name is Gregory.
```

## Step 4 - Add your age

Add a second line to your output to add your age, for example it could look
like this:

```
Hi, my name is Gregory.
I am 28 years old.
```

## Step 5 - Add one hobby or interest

Add another line to the output to tell about one hobby or interest you have. If
you have no particular hobbies or interests feel free to use your imagination
for something creative. The program's output should look similar to the
following:

```
Hi, my name is Gregory.
I am 28 years old.
My hobby is sky diving
```

## Step 6 - add one or more additional hobbies or interests

Add one or more hobbies or interests, separated by a comma (`,`) and make sure
they stay on the same line (this will be important later).

```
Hi, my name is Gregory.
I am 28 years old.
My hobbies are sky diving, fighting crime, programming and drumming
```


# Submission

You can submit the final product to me via email, for now. In the future we
will set up a git repository and you will be able to submit your code via git.
